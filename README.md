# byu-assets
A place to share BYU images, graphics, and icons (not official logos) for use on BYU Websites. (The only exception is temporarily to share the favicon until it is available officially online.) You must have permission /copyright to share these files.

These icons, graphics, and images are primarily for supplementing content on websites to improve their look and the user's experience. This collection is for the benefit of the BYU Web Community. If you are sharing these files here, you must agree that they be used free of charge, and can be appropriately modified to fit the users's needs.
